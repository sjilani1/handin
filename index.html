        <h1> Development Project </h1>


        <div class="overview">
            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> Goal: To create an interactive interface that filters, sorts and aggregates favorites from a dataset 
            </p>
            <h2> My Design </h2>
            <p> <li>The interface allows users to go through their matches and add favourites to the match-list.  </li>
            <li>The users may filter through age, location or interests of the person  </li> 
          <li> The list can be sorted by age (lowest to highest) or by alphabetical order</li>
          <li> The user has the freedom to remove a match from the match-list or refresh their filter options  </li></p>


          <h2> Comparative Analysis</h2>
          <p> I conducted a comparative analysis of three websites: Amazon, Hulu and Instagram 
            <p> Hulu </p> 
            <li> Navigating through websites to watch and adding to ‘My Stuff’ for easy access or ‘liking’ it to see similar content </li>
          <li>Users can save favourite shows to go back to but they will not be organized based on genre etc </li>

          <p> Amazon </p> 
          <li> Navigating through a shopping portal where users can add to cart or add to a list for later
          </li>
        <li>users add items they wish to purchase to a cart and similar content appears 
        </li>

        <p> Instagram </p> 
        <li>  Saving videos in folders through instagram to be able to access the content later
        </li>
      <li>This keeps all your content saved in different folders based on a theme that users can go back to and it also boosts the content for the account that created it 
      </li>

          <h2> Analysis</h2>
          <p> Amazon and Instagram seem to have the highest ease of use and clear straightforward way of bucketing items in certain lists. Both also allow for custom categorisation which gives the user more freedom. Hulu and Amazon go a step further by offering personalisation and showing similar content based on what has been selected.
            Amazon and Hulu also have more filter options based on genre/category, price, dates, reviews whereas instagram only sorts through date in which the item was added to the saved category. 
            
          </p>

          <p> Amazon 
            <Li> Strength: easiest navigation and the clearest way to form lists based on color and symbolism in the interface design </Li> 
            <li> Weakness: overload of information/ similar content which can sometimes be distracting.</li> </p>

            <p> Hulu
              <Li> Strength:simple interface design - having a nav bar element pointing to ‘My Stuff’ and a simple + button</Li> 
              <li> Weakness: not intuitive to organise all favourites in one bucket, they already have previosuly watched list on the home page so this list is redundant</li> </p>
              <p> Instagram
                <Li> Strength: simple and easy to use button, saved collection stored seperately and easy to customise </Li> 
                <li> Weakness: only filters by date and reclicking the save button removes an item from the list</li> </p>
  
       

          <h2> My Design Features</h2>
          <li> Simple and very clearly marked button to indicate how to add to a list
          </li>
          <li> 2-3 filter options that work closely with sorting the data to give users options without overloading them with unnecessary features 
          </li>
          <li>  Resetting filters and sort buttons</li>
          <li> Clear organisation of cards as well as a clear organisation when added to a saved category list </li>
          <li>  The same item cannot be added to the list twice - similar to Hulu and Instagram each item in my list is unique so it does not make sense to add it twice </li>
          <li> A separate add to list and remove from list button because the lists are stored in different areas and sometimes someone may double click by accident which does not mean remove this item from the list </li>
          <li>  I am not adding personalisation in this tool as most of the filter options allow you to screen for interests, age etc and create your own personal sub-list to choose from </li>

          <h2> Skills/Takeaways</h2>
          <li> Creating an interface that clearly depicts buttons in a way that it would be understandable even in a different language  </li>
          <li> Having simple organization and filter options </li>
          <li> Allowing users to keep changing parts of the page without having to reload the page   </li>
